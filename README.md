# Welcome to Remix!

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

### Using a Template

When you ran `npx create-remix@latest` there were a few choices for hosting. You can run that again to create a new project, then copy over your `app/` folder to the new project that's pre-configured for your target server.

```sh
cd ..
# create a new project, and pick a pre-configured host
npx create-remix@latest
cd my-new-remix-app
# remove the new project's app (not the old one!)
rm -rf app
# copy your app over
cp -R ../my-old-remix-app/app app
```

## Auth flow

- On the `/login` route.
- User submits login form.
- Form data is validated.
  - If the form data is invalid, return the form with the errors.
- Login type is "register"
  - Check whether the username is available
    - If the username is not available, return the form with an error.
  - Hash the password
  - Create a new user
- Login type is "login"
  - Check whether the user exists
    - If the user doesn't exist, return the form with an error.
  - Check whether the password hash matches
    - If the password hash doesn't match, return the form with an error.
- Create a new session
- Redirect to the `/jokes` route with the `Set-Cookie` header.
